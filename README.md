# Traffic_lights_system

This project is part of my embedded system nanodegree I took with Udacity. 

This project is built to produce a system for traffic lights using the ATmega32 microcontroller.

The project is desined in layers, Application, EUCAL, MCAL, microcontroller, and each layer consists of some drivers. 

The application layer consists of the application initialization and starting, and it includes different files for testing each of the drivers.

the project is an appplication of these concepts
- interrupts, timers and input/outputs 
- OOP and modular programming 
- callback funcitons
